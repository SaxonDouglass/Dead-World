	<p>Dead World is an adventure game with a twist - you play in a world made up of a mixture of the worlds of many other players. Every new area you explore is 'loaned' from the server, and when you die they are returned to the server with any changes you make.</p>
	<p>By rearranging resources you can construct a variety of useful buildings to help you make your way through the world:</p>
